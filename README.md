In this assignment, we'll be creating a web app that users view and leave comments on the lastest news. But you're not going to actually write any of the articles; instead we'll flex our Mongoose and Cheerio skills to scrape the news from another site. For this project I will be scraping from a website called ARS Technica, in the Game News section.

I didnt't get the app to work fully. I got all the pages and routers set up and was able to scrape the data to my terminal, but didn't get enough time to get it to append to my HTML page.
